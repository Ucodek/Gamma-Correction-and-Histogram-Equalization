# Image Enhancement with Gamma Correction and Histogram Equalization

This Python application enhances grayscale images using **Gamma Correction** and **Histogram Equalization**. It allows users to experiment with different enhancement techniques and visualize their effects.

## Features
- Apply **Gamma Correction** to adjust brightness and contrast.
- Use **Histogram Equalization** to improve image contrast.
- Compare different enhancement orders:
  - Gamma Correction → Histogram Equalization
  - Histogram Equalization → Gamma Correction
- Display the original and processed images along with their histograms.

## Installation
Clone this repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ImageEnhancement.git
cd ImageEnhancement
pip install -r requirements.txt

image_path = "your_image.jpg"  # Change this to your image path
